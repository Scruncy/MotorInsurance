Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed for this project. These dependencies should be listed in the requirements.txt file or specified in the documentation.

File Download
It is recommended to download all the necessary files to your computer, especially the .pkl files. These files are critical for the smooth operation of the program.

Running the Program
If you don't download the .pkl files, the first step when running the program is to execute the analysis process. This will generate the required .pkl files automatically.

Execution
Once all necessary files are in place, you can run the program by executing the main.py file. This script serves as the entry point for the program and allows you to perform various tasks with the system.
From there, you can interact with the program and perform any desired operations.
